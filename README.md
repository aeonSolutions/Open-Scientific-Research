# Open Science Research

Open science is a transformative approach to research and knowledge dissemination that emphasizes transparency, collaboration, and accessibility. It encourages scientists and researchers to make their work, including data, methodologies, and findings, openly available to the public and the global scientific community. This not only fosters greater trust in the scientific process but also accelerates the pace of discovery by enabling others to build upon and validate existing research. Open science promotes interdisciplinary collaboration and reduces duplication of efforts, ultimately leading to more robust and reproducible scientific results. By breaking down barriers to access, open science democratizes knowledge, making it available to a wider audience, thus benefiting society as a whole. It represents a significant shift in the way science is conducted and shared, ushering in an era of more inclusive and accountable research.

# Planned Projects

<br>

## [4D Science Project - beyond static research communications](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/Aeonlabs-4D-Science-Project---beyond-static-research-communications/tree/main)
project not yet started. <br>

The main idea foe this project is to develop a work environment using Unreal Engine 5.x where is possible to work experimental data beyond a 2D spread sheet , in particular time dependent experimental data that requires motion graphics and animated chart plots.

<br>

## [Smart Asphalt Roads Project](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/aeonlabs-open-science-Smart-Asphalt-Roads-Project/tree/main)
project started. <br>

I've started preliminary work on my future project in the area of "self-sensing asphalt" for smart roads and highways. The very first task is to understand embedded wireless radio transmission into the surface of the asphalt road itself. This project is scheduled to resume next month of December, 2023.

<br>

## [Rammed Earth Project](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/aeonlabs-open-science-rammed_earth_project/wiki) 
project started. <br>

I've started preliminary works on my future project in the area of "rammed earth" construction. The very first task is to understand embedded sensors in construction materials like this one. This project is scheduled to resume next month of December, 2023.

## [Validation of Experimental Data Origins: A Swarm of DAQ devices able to Deliver Unique Experimental Data using Blockchain-like Fingerprint ID to a Data Repository](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/openScience-Smart-DAQ-to-Upload-Live-Experimental-Data-to-a-Data-Repository)
ongoing project. <br>

This Sci. research presents an innovative method for experimental data acquisition and management of collected data in real-time and is compatible with any open environment. The proposed smart DAQ device prototype has the minimum hardware characteristics to handle data measurements collected from sensors locally connected to it, store it on a local CSV or SQLite database file, and finally connect and synchronize data measurements collected with a data repository hosted remotely on a Dataverse.

These Smart DAQ devices are of type "Internet of Everything" (IoE) Smart Devices and are able to connect with each other using swarm intelligence. The main purpose is to increase data integrity and trustworthiness among DAQ devices connected and on all experimental data collected during an experiment or research project.

## [A Smart Device for Structural Self-Sensing Carbon Fiber-Based Composites](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/openScience-Smart-Device-for-Structural-Self-Sensing-Carbon-Fiber-Based-Composites-)
project completed. <br>

**A Deep Neural Network for Electrical Resistance Calibration of Self-Sensing Carbon Fiber Polymer Composites compatible with Edge Computing Structural Monitoring Hardware ElectronicsA Deep Neural Network for Electrical Resistance Calibration of Self-Sensing Carbon Fiber Polymer Composites compatible with Edge Computing Structural Monitoring Hardware Electronics** 

*accepted for publication in the Journal of [Structural Health Monitoring](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/shm) (5yr Impact factor of 5.9) Â· Mar 24, 2023*

</p>

The self-sensing ability of materials, in particular carbon fiber polymer composites (SSCFPC), is a must-have requirement when designing a structural monitoring
network for remote assessment of structural serviceability. This work presents a study using an Artificial Deep Neural Network (ADNN) where is evaluated the electrical resistance (R) output of specimens subjected to an unchanged deformation state of 2,86% strain for prolonged periods of time. 

Six ADNN architectures are evaluated with varying numbers of neurons on pre-defined hidden layers, sharing the same four data inputs and one output. The dataset is based on 3,276 data points collected during the experimental campaign of an innovative electrode design embedded in SSCFPC specimens. The eï¬ect of the number of iterations and the architecture of the neural network is investigated in proposed ADNN models. Simple moving average (SMA), and moving Standard Deviation, are determined and plotted in terms of z-score to assist in performance evaluation of proposed ADNN models.
