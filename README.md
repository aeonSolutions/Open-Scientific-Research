Open science is a transformative approach to research and knowledge dissemination that emphasizes transparency, collaboration, and accessibility. It encourages scientists and researchers to make their work, including data, methodologies, and findings, openly available to the public and the global scientific community. This not only fosters greater trust in the scientific process but also accelerates the pace of discovery by enabling others to build upon and validate existing research. Open science promotes interdisciplinary collaboration and reduces duplication of efforts, ultimately leading to more robust and reproducible scientific results. By breaking down barriers to access, open science democratizes knowledge, making it available to a wider audience, thus benefiting society as a whole. It represents a significant shift in the way science is conducted and shared, ushering in an era of more inclusive and accountable research. <sub>(*source: chat.openai.com*)</sub>

### How I do my scientific research
For the past 4 years now, I've been conceptualizing and prototyping open hardware electronics for Smart Data Acquisition Devices (S.D.A.D.) capable of sending, in real-time, experimental data collected from a single specimen/sample directly to a "data repository". Not only that, these smart DAQs are able to authenticate and sign each individual data record in such a way that I am able to argue on any of my research documents and publications, that research data is from a trustworthy origin. The setup is simple: one S.D.A.D. for each individual specimen/sample connected to a swarm of devices capable of collecting and sending experimental data in real-time to a repository. To learn more about this project I invite the reader to [click here](https://aeonsolutions.github.io/products/smart_data_acquisition/index.html) to open the project's repository here on GitHub. This is an open scientific project where anyone is invited to participate and collaborate. 

 This is how I want my science to happen. to minimize possible questioning and distrust of data origins and how it was collected and stored during an experimental campaign I set up and supervised. For more information about this growing concern, read "[Why Most Published Research Findings Are False](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Most_Published_Research_Findings_Are_False#:~:text=Ioannidis%27s%20theoretical%20model%20fails%20to,%2C%20not%20greater%20than%2050%25.)".

# Planned Projects
Scientific project planning is a vital stage in the research process, requiring careful consideration and organization. It involves defining the project's objectives, specifying research questions, and outlining the experimental or investigative approach. Researchers meticulously plan methodologies, taking into account available resources, budget constraints, and ethical considerations. Establishing clear timelines and milestones ensures progress tracking, while a comprehensive literature review helps position the project within the broader scientific context. Effective communication among team members is crucial, fostering collaboration and a shared understanding of project goals. In essence, scientific project planning sets the groundwork for a systematic and well-executed research endeavor, enhancing the likelihood of producing valuable and meaningful results. <sub>(*source: chat.openai.com*)</sub>

# Ongoing Projects

## [Validation of Experimental Data Origins: A Swarm of DAQ devices able to Deliver Unique Experimental Data using Blockchain-like Fingerprint ID to a Data Repository](https://aeonsolutions.github.io/products/smart_data_acquisition/index.html)
**current project Total: > 8000 work.h** <br>
<sup>**Status:** Ongoing Project </sup> <br>

This Sci. research presents an innovative method for experimental data acquisition and management of collected data in real-time and is compatible with any open environment. The proposed smart DAQ device prototype has the minimum hardware characteristics to handle data measurements collected from sensors locally connected to it, store it on a local CSV or SQLite database file, and finally connect and synchronize data measurements collected with a data repository hosted remotely on a Dataverse.

These Smart DAQ devices are of type "Internet of Everything" (IoE) Smart Devices and are able to connect with each other using swarm intelligence. The main purpose is to increase data integrity and trustworthiness among DAQ devices connected and on all experimental data collected during an experiment or research project.

Logistics with real-time management of work activities at a construction site, including building materials and human resources, is an innovation for micro and small enterprises starting up in the construction sector. Enterprises of this size are being run using traditional turn-of-the-century technology tools, namely, excel spreadsheets as data storage. This paper presents a case study of technology implementation at a startup enterprise in the Belgian construction sector between 2018 and mid-2020, and discusses the challenges needed to overcome during the period of digital transformation. A multi-environment logistics platform was designed and prototyped following human-centered design principles enabling the enterprise to move forward and improve work methodologies to work with real-time data. Results after 18 months demonstrated an increased efficiency in all work processes, with a reduction of losses in all aspects of work activities and improved control of production estimates and measurements

</p>

The self-sensing ability of materials, in particular carbon fiber polymer composites (SSCFPC), is a must-have requirement when designing a structural monitoring
network for remote assessment of structural serviceability. This work presents a study using an Artificial Deep Neural Network (ADNN) where is evaluated the electrical resistance (R) output of specimens subjected to an unchanged deformation state of 2,86% strain for prolonged periods of time. 

Six ADNN architectures are evaluated with varying numbers of neurons on pre-defined hidden layers, sharing the same four data inputs and one output. The dataset is based on 3,276 data points collected during the experimental campaign of an innovative electrode design embedded in SSCFPC specimens. The eﬀect of the number of iterations and the architecture of the neural network is investigated in proposed ADNN models. Simple moving average (SMA), and moving Standard Deviation, are determined and plotted in terms of z-score to assist in performance evaluation of proposed ADNN models.
